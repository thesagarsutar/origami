## Essense of Origami

* When any flat material is **folded and unfolded**, the sheet of material transforms from one thing to another.
* The flat sheet of paper, which was nothing before sometime, has been transformed into something else.

  ```
                          Nothing -> Something
  ```

* Folding a piece of paper is not simply a change, but its **transformation** in space and time.

* As the essense of origami is in action of folding and unfolding, in most of cases, projects, we see the origami principles have been applied to solve the transportation and portibility related issues.



#### **Synthesis**

Origami is tranformation of flat sheet from 2 dimention into 3-dimention, through the actions of folding and unfolding the sheet.
