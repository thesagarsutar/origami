**Developed an origami as a hobby**

I was navie to origami before starting this project. I never actively practiced the art of paperfolding, all I was aware about the there is an origami art form. Over the last one year, I took active interest in learning origami. Me and nandhini, along the line started origami marathon, the creadit goes to Nandhini, for starting origami marathon. I now started sseeing folds more consciously than before, I feel the project has served a larger purpose in my life and others than initially thought.



**Transformation in my design process**

All of my earlier projects were missing conceptual depth that I was expecting. Through graduation project, I am able engage in depth with topic, this has certainly helped to analyse my own design process and improve it through practice.  Learning of the graduation projects can be applied to any project here onwards, hoever small or large project with any timelimits.
