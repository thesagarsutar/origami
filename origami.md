Akira Yoshizava is considered as father of origami. He is considered as one of the master origami artists of the ancient time. He is famous for his innovative folding techniques as well as more famously he is considered as the inventor of notation system.  He also pioneered a system of origami notation that allows readers of any language to follow a set of printed instructions. Using dotted lines to indicate the folds and arrows to indicate the directions of the folds, the system is widely used today. He had defined the notation language for origami, consisting of arrows, symbols and terms which are widely accepted uiversally. In his hands, a flat shit of paper would give a birth to birds in the air, fish in the water and flora and fauna of the earth.

> Akira Yoshizawa, tried not to make origami sculpures lifelike, but "living" like - Ms. Sakamoto

Folded according to a rigid set of rules that had remained unchanged for generations, origami figures were usually flat and static. Mr. Yoshizawa, who was self-taught, broke with tradition. He pioneered a technique, known as wet folding, that allows dampened paper to be molded into sculptural forms, like the marvelously ugly crenellations of a gorilla's face.[^2]

He never tried to make origami objects look as realistic as possible, his intent was to express emotions and feeling through origami object. Thats is how he raised the origami from the craft to live art form.
