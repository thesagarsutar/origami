#### **Growth**![](/assets/import.png)

GROWTH with its origami-based geometry, transforms and grows with plant, as the plant itself unfolds. The life cycle of plant is transformation: from seed to full grown size, the blooming of flower, the unfolding of leaf, the branching of roots. This is what GROWTH aims to capture within a plant pot.[^1]

#### SA umbrella![](/assets/import1.png)

Designers collaborated to re-imagine and redefine the structure, form and aesthetics of umbrella. Like origami, the design uses planar tension to generate its form, with the inner and outer canopies moving in unison to open and close the umbrella.[^2]
