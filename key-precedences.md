**Growth**![](/assets/import.png)

GROWTH with its origami-based geometry, transforms and grows with plant, as the plant itself unfolds. The life cycle of plant is transformation: from seed to full grown size, the blooming of flower, the unfolding of leaf, the branching of roots. This is what GROWTH aims to capture within a plant pot.
