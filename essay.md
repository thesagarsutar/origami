_If you give a child a sheet of paper, when he or she doesn’t have any colored pencils to play with, his or her first reaction will be to fold it. That’s the spontaneity of folding! Just as the folds of the waves animate the sea, a single fold in a sheet will bring any flat surface to life. – Nicole Charneau_

Just as the carpenter gives the shape to the wood, potter works with the clay – the paper folder, sculpts the paper to get life out of paper. The out of nothingness and goes back to nothing, whatever comes from the nature, goes back to the nature.

**Folds give the identity**

Just as the potter gives form to mud on potter wheel, a paper artists, folds the paper to give a form and form something new. Folds gives the forms, when the plain sheet is folded, it can form a box, hexagon, pyramid. This form, identifies the object, yourecognize, this box is either air conditioner, or a package carton, or simple notebook, in front of you. Folds give the form and form defines the identity of the objects.

**Folds are the medium of expression**

Emotions are expressed on face, wrinkles on the face represents the worry. When i am happy, i live in moment, releasing all my body. If someone gets me angry, I go into my shell, I fold my body, I become rigid person. Simple blink on the eyes, indicates the liveliness of a person. In a way, blink is folding and unfolding of an eyelid. Folds create awakens the curiosity. Folds are the expression of life. A simple fold on plane wall brings the life to the wall. In a way, folds are the expressions of life. And unfolding is reverse folding? Just as single wave on the surface of sea, animates the sea, a single fold on the piece of paper, bring the paper back to life.

**Folds - Aesthetics and functions**

Folds in origami serves the two purposes, the first important point to notice is that, origami folds provide the aesthetics to the object at the same time they have functional use for the folds. Folds exist with the paradoxical nature, folds provide the stiffness, and folds provide the flexibility.

**Folds – signify the growth**

As the plant grows over the period of time, it unfolds itself in all the dimensions. When sun-rays fall onto the flowers, leaves, they starts unfolding slowly. Folded things when unfolded they open up in time and space. The leaf of the plant grows over the period of time. In a way growth aspect of a plant or any living organism can be looked as unfolding in space and time. As the plant grown from the seed to the full tree, over the period of time unfolding the mystery begins.

**Folds –Signifies the memory**

Single fold on the sheet of paper can be associated with the concept of memory. If the folded paper is unfolded the crease remains on the paper, permanently.

**Folds – Give the life**

Just as the waves in the sea animate the sea, the single fold on the piece of paper, gives the life to the paper. If wall of the building is made folded, instead of like a flat surface, it looks like as if there is life in wall.

**Folds – A mystery, an essence**

**Mobius strip fold and meaning**

**Folds – two make the one, experiencing no duality through folds**

Making folds conscious. Folds are everywhere, every living species encounter the folds right from the birth t the death. When the child is in the womb of mother, it is folded. Heart pumps, brain has folds in it, body is folded, cells are folded, DNAs are folded. Folds are present inside out. Sound-wave is folded. Vibrations happens through folds. Folds are visible and invisible. Folds are not folds, folds make the life.



Folds allow me to open forms and to deep inside them; they allow me to stimulate my creativity by forcing me to develop strategies for working with the situation they impose on me, a bit like playing a game of chess.
