**Folds give the identity**

Just as the potter gives form to mud on potterwheel, a paper artists, folds the paper to give a form and form something new. Folds gives the forms, when the plain sheet is folded, it can form a box, hexagon, pyramid. This form, identifies the object, you recognise, this box is either air conditioner, or a package caton, or simple notebook, infront of you. Folds give the form and form defines the identity of the objects.

**Folds are the medium of expression**

Emotions are expressed on face, wrinkles on the face represents the worry. When i am happy, i live in moment, releasing all my body. If someone gets me angry, I go into my shell, I fold my body, i become rigid person. Simple blink on the eyes, indicates the liveliness of a person. In a way, blink is folding and unfolding of an eyelid. Folds create awakens the cusiosity. Folds are the expression of life. A simpe fold on plane wall brings the life to the wall. In a way, folds are the expressions of life. And unfolding is reverse folding? Just as single wave on the surface of sea, animates the sea, a single fold on the piece of paper, bring the paper back to life.

**Folds - Aesthetics and functions**

**Folds - Motion Originate at the movement of folds**
