Whereever we see in the nature, we see folds in flowers, leaves, plants, branches, waves, soundwaves, air, earth, protiens etc.

* Motion, sound, light and folding. -- Folds in movement produces motion, sound when folded can be redirected in one perticular direction, What if we are able to fold the light?
* Is there any relation between folds and emotions. When person is angry, he encloses the body, when happy unfolds his body, microexpressions on forehead, smiles on face. everywhere we see folds in visible/invisible form.
