# Introduction

I started with the topic of origami, as an instinct I got when i was making greeting card for my fried. This one perticular greeting card I made was very simple, it opens up vertically, the corners of the central fold of the greeting card where folded inside, further representing hands of the creature "Minion".

I thought to experiement with origami and technology, the blending of these two domains might looks very cliche to designers, but I am trying to explore this blend to different direction and dimention.
