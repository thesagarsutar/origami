### Introduction

I started with the topic of origami, when I was making greeting card for my friend, I got an instinctive idea to work on the folding. This one perticular greeting card I made was very simple, it opens up vertically, the corners of the central fold of the greeting card were folded inside, further representing hands of the creature "Minion".

I thought to experiement with origami and technology, the blending of these two domains might looks very cliche to designers, but I am trying to explore this blend to different direction and dimention.
